# Vector calculation
1+2
# vector calculation in a different form
"+"(1,2)

# Sum.
c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)
# Product
c(1, 2, 3) * c(4, 5, 6)
# Division
c(10, 20, 30) / c(2, 4, 6)
# Remainder
c(10, 20, 30) %% c(3, 5, 7)
# Quotient
c(10, 20, 30) %/% c(3, 5, 7)


# vector calculation of different length of vectors - recycling rule
c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
# vector + scalar(vector with one element)
c(1, 3, 5) + 10

# the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of a shorter vector
c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
